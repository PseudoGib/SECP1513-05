#Introduction
  In this report, we are discussing the process of design thinking and the problems that people are facing nowadays. The title of our design thinking is ‘Smart Helmet’. We have used the helmet that already exists in the market and evolved it to become a product that is more satisfying to customer’s needs. Our purpose in doing this ‘Smart Helmet’ is safety first. Motorcycles are used as a means of transportation. It is an indispensable thing in our daily life. When we are riding a motorcycle, the most important step is to wear a helmet to prevent injury to our brain. During the research, we found that in Malaysia there have been a lot of motorcycle accident cases. To worsen the situation, some people may lose their lives in motorcycle accidents. We found that the main reasons why the accident happened were the road conditions and the weather. It is very dangerous when the rider is riding on a rainy day because the motorcycle can’t be controlled easily by the rider on a winding road or due to some emergency we are forced to break suddenly. Besides, it is hard for riders to be aware of the road without any psychological preparation and notification. Therefore, they cannot react immediately when they encounter road holes. At that time an accident may happen. Through this issue mentioned by the above statement, we have decided to create the ‘Smart Helmet’ to solve this problem effectively.

#Detail step and evidence in each step
  Before we start our project, we need to do some research to have a better understanding of our project. First and foremost, we need to find the problems from the rider’s perspective. For example,  we must know what the rider feels, thinks, and faces while riding. This can help us in doing a project that can fulfill the requirements of the riders and try to solve the problem. We have decided to interview with one of the riders who has a driver’s license for 2 years.
