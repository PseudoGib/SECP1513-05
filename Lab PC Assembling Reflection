On 25th October 2023, we had a Lab PC Assembling.
We learned how to disassemble a PC step by step.
1. Open the case by unscrew it
2. Take off the cable
3. Take off the Power supply
4. Take off the RAM
5. Take off the Hardisk Drive
6. Take off the fan
We work in a team of 5 people and we learn each of the PC components.
After the PC components were disassembled, we were told to assemble them in time.
We were successful by the first time we assemble it again.
This Lab activity sure given me experiences in assembling and disassembling PC
